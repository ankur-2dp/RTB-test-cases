# Real Time Billing (RTB) Test Cases with Ginkgo

This repository contains test cases implemented using Ginkgo for testing Real Time Billing (RTB) transactions.

## Overview

In this repository, we utilize Ginkgo, a BDD-style testing framework for Go (Golang) programming language, to test various cases involved in Real Time Billing (RTB) transactions. These tests aim to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the RTB transaction processing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the unit tests, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Go (Golang) - [Installation Guide](https://golang.org/doc/install)
